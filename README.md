# AIDA - AI Usage Transparency for Creatives

[**AIDA** stands for "AI Included Disclosure Acknowledgment" and is a tribute to Ada Lovelace, a 19th Century female computer pioneer.] 

The goal of this project is two-fold: 

1. First, to bring more awareness to the changing nature of creativity, authenticity and contribution as it relates to GenerativeAI. See Manifesto. 
2. Second, to provide simple templates that help creators state what role AI had in their creative output or creative process. See Examples. 

For suggestions, discussion, or comments, please submit to issue queue: https://github.com/markwk/aida/issues
